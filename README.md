# Repo0001
This is my first Repo

# This is the largest heading 
### this is like H3 on Html I think it is the middle heading
###### this is should be the smallest heading

*this italic*
**this should be bold**
we can make a nested style of those above in one sentence or statment here one of the examples:
**this is bold speach contain *ITALIC* and ~~STRIKETHROUGH~~ text**
also we can apply more than one command in the same part like this
	***All this text is important***

> this is quote text
> fdssfdsf
> fdsfafsf
> sdfasfsfasf

this example about some formated text below 
```
git statusddd            ddffdf



git add
git commit
as you can see we can use the spaces here when ever we want 
```

after that here we have the links format in MD 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
