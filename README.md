# Repo0001
This is my first Repo

# This is the largest heading 
### this is like H3 on Html I think it is the middle heading
###### this is should be the smallest heading

*this italic*
**this should be bold**
we can make a nested style of those above in one sentence or statment here one of the examples:
**this is bold speach contain *ITALIC* and ~~STRIKETHROUGH~~ text**
also we can apply more than one command in the same part like this
	***All this text is important***

> this is quote text
> fdssfdsf
> fdsfafsf
> sdfasfsfasf

this example about some formated text below 
```
git statusddd            ddffdf



git add
git commit
as you can see we can use the spaces here when ever we want 
```

after that here we have the links format in MD 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

here unorder list 
- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson

here some text using order list 
1. yaser
2. like
3. this
4. class

Note we can make nested list and we can change the list decoration type to begin from another beginning
And there's a lot of commands to do the MD file Design I will revision them when I'm applying my required laps
